## Scalable Web Application with ALB and Auto Scaling
Deploy a highly available and scalable web application using Amazon EC2, Application Load Balancer (ALB), and Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) .

### 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to deploy a scalable web application on AWS, ensuring high availability, performance optimization, and security . The architecture includes EC2 instances, ALB for traffic distribution, ASG for dynamic scaling, and optional RDS for persistent storage .

### 🏗 Architecture Diagram
- Use Lucidchart or AWS Diagram tools to visualize the following architecture :

- User Request → ALB → Auto Scaling Group (EC2 Instances) → (Optional) Amazon RDS
Key AWS Services Used
EC2 – Hosts the web application.

- Application Load Balancer (ALB) – Routes traffic among EC2 instances.

- Auto Scaling Group (ASG) – Adjusts instance count dynamically.

- Amazon RDS (Optional) – Backend database with Multi-AZ failover .

- IAM – Secure access control for AWS resources .

- CloudWatch & SNS – Performance monitoring & alert notifications.

### 🚀 Deployment Guide
#### 1️⃣ Create an EC2 Instance
- Log in to AWS Console .

- Navigate to EC2 → Instances and launch a new instance .

- Choose an Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu AMI .

- Configure security groups to allow HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) .

- Install your web application (e.g., Apache, Nginx) .

#### 2️⃣ Configure ALB (Application Load Balancer)
- Go to EC2 → Load Balancers → Create ALB .

- Set up listeners (HTTP, HTTPS) .

- Configure target groups to register EC2 instances .

#### 3️⃣ Set Up Auto Scaling
- Navigate to EC2 → Auto Scaling Groups → Create ASG .

- Define scaling policies based on CPU usage (e.g., scale-out at 60% CPU) .

- Attach the ALB to ensure balanced traffic .

#### 4️⃣ (Optional) Set Up Amazon RDS
- Create an RDS instance (MySQL/PostgreSQL) .

- Enable Multi-AZ for failover protection .

- Modify security groups to allow access from EC2 instances .

### 🔍 Monitoring & Alerts
- Enable CloudWatch metrics to track EC2 and ALB performance :
``` 
  aws cloudwatch get-metric-data --metric-name CPUUtilization --namespace AWS/EC2 

  ```
- Set up SNS notifications for scaling alerts .

### 🔒 Security Considerations
- IAM Roles – Assign permissions to EC2 for accessing S3/RDS . 
- Security Groups – Restrict access to specific ports . 
- HTTPS Configuration – Use SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication .

### ✅ Expected Outcomes
- 🚀 High availability with ALB & ASG .

- 📈 Automatic scaling to optimize performance .

- 🔒 Secure IAM roles & network configurations .

- 💰 Cost efficiency by scaling only when needed .
